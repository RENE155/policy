# Privacy Policy for rsi tracker

**Last Updated:** [Current Date - Apr 02, 2025]

This Privacy Policy describes how rsi tracker ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application (the "Service").

**Information We Collect**

We may collect the following types of information:

1.  **Information You Provide:**
    *   We currently do not require users to create accounts or directly provide personal information like name or email address to use the core features of the app. If you contact us for support via email, we will collect your email address and any information you provide in your correspondence.

2.  **Information Collected Automatically:**
    *   **Usage Data:** We may collect information about how you access and use the Service, such as device type, operating system, unique device identifiers (like Advertising ID or IDFA, where applicable and allowed by user settings), IP address, crash reports, and feature usage patterns. This helps us understand how the app is used and identify areas for improvement.
    *   **Purchase Information:** If you purchase subscriptions or premium features within the app, transaction details are processed by the Google Play Store and potentially our subscription management partner, RevenueCat. We receive necessary information (like anonymized purchase tokens or subscription status) to validate and manage your subscription but do not access or store your full payment card details.

**How We Use Your Information**

We use the information we collect for various purposes, including:

*   To provide, operate, and maintain our Service, including premium features for subscribers.
*   To process transactions and manage your subscriptions.
*   To improve, personalize, and expand our Service based on usage patterns.
*   To understand and analyze how you use our Service to enhance user experience and fix bugs.
*   To communicate with you for customer service or support requests initiated by you.
*   To detect and prevent fraud or misuse of the Service.
*   For compliance purposes, including enforcing our terms and responding to legal requests.

**Sharing Your Information**

We may share your information in the following situations:

*   **With Service Providers:** We share necessary information with third-party vendors and service providers that perform services on our behalf, such as payment processing and subscription management (Google Play, RevenueCat) and analytics providers (if any). These providers only have access to the information necessary to perform their functions and are obligated to protect your data according to their own privacy policies.
*   **For Legal Reasons:** We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).
*   **Business Transfers:** If rsi tracker is involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, user information may be transferred as part of that transaction.

**Data Security**

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to help protect your information from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, please be aware that no electronic transmission or storage method is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

**Your Data Rights**

Depending on your location and applicable laws, you may have rights regarding your personal data. Since we collect limited personal information, exercising these rights might pertain primarily to data held by third-party services like Google Play or RevenueCat according to their policies. For any data we might hold directly (e.g., support emails), you can contact us to inquire about access or deletion.

**Children's Privacy**

Our Service is not intended for or directed to individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will take steps to delete it promptly. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the app or via other appropriate means. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes are effective when they are posted.
